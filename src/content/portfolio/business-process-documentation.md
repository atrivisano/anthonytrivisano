# Challenge section
challengeIntroduction: "Organizations were struggling with inconsistent implementation of business processes, knowledge silos, and ineffective knowledge transfer when team members transitioned roles or left the company."
challenges: [
  "Undocumented or poorly documented business processes leading to inconsistent implementation",
  "Knowledge silos creating single points of failure when key team members were unavailable",
  "Inefficient onboarding due to lack of standardized training materials",
  "Difficulty maintaining consistent quality standards across teams and projects",
  "Challenges in process improvement due to unclear understanding of current workflows",
  "Ineffective knowledge transfer during team transitions or organizational changes"
]
