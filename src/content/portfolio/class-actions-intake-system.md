# Challenge section
challengeIntroduction: "The Class Action department at Siskinds LLP needed a secure, efficient system to handle large volumes of client data across multiple class action matters. The existing solution relied on manual spreadsheets and disparate documents, creating inefficiencies and data management challenges."
challenges: [
  "Securely collecting sensitive client information through public-facing web forms",
  "Maintaining data separation between different class action matters",
  "Enabling legal teams to create custom intake forms without developer assistance",
  "Integrating with the firm's closed network while maintaining security protocols",
  "Ensuring GDPR and privacy law compliance for sensitive client information",
  "Creating workflows for data manipulation, reporting, and exports"
]

# Solution section
solutionIntroduction: "I developed a comprehensive Laravel-based application that addressed all client requirements with a focus on security, usability, and scalability."

  {
    title: "Secure Backend System",
    description: "A Laravel application for storing and managing client data with role-based access controls, audit logging, and encryption for sensitive fields."
  },
  {
    title: "Dynamic Form Builder",
    description: "An intuitive interface allowing legal teams to create custom intake forms with field validation, conditional logic, and document uploads tailored to specific class action matters."
  },
  {
    title: "API Bridge",
    description: "A secure API layer that connected the closed network system to public-facing WordPress sites where clients could submit information."
  },
  {
    title: "WordPress Plugin",
    description: "A custom plugin that consumed the API endpoints to render appropriate forms on specific pages and securely transmit client submissions."
  }

# Development Process
process: [
  {
    title: "Requirements Gathering & UML Modeling",
    description: "I began by conducting thorough stakeholder interviews with the Class Action team to understand their unique workflows. Using this information, I created UML diagrams to model the data relationships, user roles, and process flows."
  },
  {
    title: "Backend Development",
    description: "I developed the Laravel application using a robust service-oriented architecture. This included creating a flexible database schema to accommodate various class action types, implementing role-based access controls, and building a comprehensive audit trail."
  },
  {
    title: "API Development",
    description: "I designed a secure RESTful API with token-based authentication, rate limiting, and input validation. This API served as the critical bridge between the secure internal system and public-facing forms."
  },
  {
    title: "WordPress Integration",
    description: "I developed a custom WordPress plugin that consumed the API endpoints, rendering dynamic forms based on class action parameters. This included client-side validation and progressive form saving."
  },
  {
    title: "Testing & Deployment",
    description: "Rigorous testing was conducted including unit tests, integration tests, security audits, and user acceptance testing. The system was deployed in phases with comprehensive training."

# Technical highlights
technical: [
  {
    title: "Dynamic Form Builder",
    description: "The custom form builder was built using a component-based architecture that allowed for complex nested forms with conditional logic. Staff could drag and drop fields, set validation rules, and create form sections that dynamically appeared based on previous answers."
  },
  {
    title: "Secure API Architecture",
    description: "The API implemented OAuth 2.0 authentication with time-limited tokens, comprehensive request validation, and rate limiting to prevent abuse. All transmitted data was encrypted in transit using TLS 1.3."
  },
  {
    title: "Data Processing Pipeline",
    description: "A sophisticated data processing pipeline was implemented for handling and normalizing submitted information. This included address standardization, duplicate detection algorithms, and data enrichment processes."
  },
  {
    title: "WordPress Integration",
    description: "The WordPress plugin used a modular architecture with clear separation of concerns. It utilized WordPress transients for caching form definitions to minimize API calls and implemented progressive form saving."
